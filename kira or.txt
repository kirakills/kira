<h1>1. Javascript</h1>

<pre><p style="font-size:19px;font-family:sans-serif">Javascript is a high-level programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It is used
as a client-side programming language by 97.8 percent of all websites. JavaScript was originally used only to develop web 
browsers, but they are now used for server-side website deployments and non-web browser applications as well.
Javascript was created in 1995 and was initially known as LiveScript. However, Java was a very popular language at that time,
so it was advertised as a “younger brother” of Java.

Javascript is the most popular programming language in the world and is in high demand among various organizations.
The average Java developer earns around $112,152 each year.

<h2>2. Python</h2>
<pre><p style="font-size:19px;font-family:sans-serif">Python is one of the most popular programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because ofits readability.
It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services,
user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications.
It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications.

Python is used for scientific and computational applications like FreeCAD and Abacus and by popular websites like YouTube, Quora, Pinterest,
and Instagram. Python developers earn average annual salaries of about $109,092. </p></pre>

<pre><p style=font-size:19px;"font-family:sans-serif">Java is one of the most popular programming languages used today.Owned by Oracle Corporation, this general-purpose
programming language with its object-oriented structure has become a standard for applications that can be used regardless of
platform (e.g., Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.) because of its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capabilities.As a result,
Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones.Today there are more than
3 billion devices running applications built with Java.

Java is a more complex language to learn, but experienced developers with Java coding skills are in high demand. 
The average Java developer earns around $109,225 each year.

object-oriented programming. 
It is one of the most used programming languages for the .NET framework. Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says
the language is more like C++ than Java.

C# is best suited for applications on Windows, Android, and iOS, as it takes the help of the integrated development environment
product,Microsoft Visual C++.
C# is used on the back end of several popular websites like Bing, Dell, Visual Studio, and MarketWatch. 
C# developers earn around $111,760 per year.</p></pre>
